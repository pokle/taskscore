# IGC Analysis Tool Specification

## Overview

The IGC Analysis Tool is a browser-based flight analysis application that allows pilots to visualize and analyze their paragliding/hanggliding flights. It parses IGC files, displays the track on an interactive 3D map, and detects flight events for analysis.

Single page app
- source `web/frontend/src/analysis.html`
- Deployed to https://glidecomp.com/analysis

## Features

### File Input
- **IGC File Upload**: Drag-and-drop or file picker for IGC files
- **XContest Task Code**: Load competition tasks by entering the task code from xcontest.org

### Map Display
All map visual details (colors, widths, fonts, interactions) are defined in [`mapbox-interactions-spec.md`](mapbox-interactions-spec.md) — the single source of truth for all map providers.

### Track Interaction
Users can click directly on the flight track to view event details:

- **Click on Track**: Clicking anywhere on the track selects the corresponding event
  - If the clicked point is within a segment (glide, thermal, or sink), that segment is selected
  - The event panel opens automatically if closed
  - The panel switches to the appropriate tab (Glides, Climbs, or Sinks) based on segment type
  - The map pans to the event location with segment highlighting
- **Hover Feedback**: Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over the track to indicate it's clickable

This provides an alternative to browsing the event panel - pilots can click directly on interesting parts of the track to see details.

### Command Palette (⌘K)
Quick access menu for display options and actions.

**Display Options:**
- **Toggle 3D Track** - Show/hide 3D track rendering with drone follow camera (on/off indicator)
- **Toggle Task** - Show/hide task visualization (cylinders, route lines, labels) - persisted via `?task-visible=0` URL param
- **Toggle Track** - Show/hide flight track and event markers - persisted via `?track-visible=0` URL param
- **Show Track Metrics** - Show/hide speed overlay with glide chevrons and labels for all glide segments (on/off indicator)
- **Switch Map Provider** - Toggle between MapBox GL and Leaflet

**File Operations:**
- **Open IGC file** - File picker for IGC upload
- **Import XContest task** - Enter task code to load from XContest

**Sample Flights:**
- Quick load sample IGC files for testing

**Settings:**
- **Configure units...** - Opens dialog to configure display units (see below)

### Units Configuration

Users can configure display units for measurements via the "Configure units..." option in the command palette. See `configurable-units-spec.md` (in this directory) for full details.

**Configurable Units:**
| Unit Type | Options | Default |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Speed | km/h, mph, knots | km/h |
| Altitude | m, ft | m |
| Distance | km, mi, nmi | km |
| Climb Rate | m/s, ft/min, knots | m/s |

**Key Features:**
- All values update immediately when units are changed (no page refresh required)
- Preferences persist in localStorage
- Accessed via command palette: Cmd+K → "Configure units..."

### Event Detection
The tool automatically detects and displays:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Takeoff | First moment of significant ground speed (>5 m/s) |
| Landing | Last moment of significant ground speed |
| Thermal Entry | Start of sustained climb (>0.5 m/s average) |
| Thermal Exit | End of thermal with altitude gain reported |
| Glide Start/End | Straight glide segments between thermals |
| Turnpoint Entry/Exit | Crossing turnpoint cylinder boundaries |
| Start Crossing | Crossing SSS cylinder (race start) |
| Goal Crossing | Crossing goal cylinder/line |
| Max/Min Altitude | Altitude extremes during flight |
| Max Climb/Sink | Maximum vertical speeds |

### Event Panel
Sidebar panel with tabbed interface for viewing flight data. The main tabs appear in the header bar and control the sidebar content.

**Header Tabs (always visible):**
- **Track** - Flight track analysis with sub-tabs for events, glides, climbs, and sinks
- **Task** - Task turnpoints with optimized distances, radii, and altitudes
- **Score** - Scoring breakdown (when a scored task is loaded)
- **>>** (Hide) - Collapses the sidebar to show full map; clicking any other tab reopens it

**Track Tab Sub-tabs:**
- **Events** - Chronological list of all detected events (takeoff, thermals, glides, landing, etc.)
- **Glides** - Glides sorted by distance (longest first), combining start/end info into single entries
- **Climbs** - Thermals sorted by altitude gain (highest first), combining entry/exit info into single entries
- **Sinks** - Glides with poor L/D ratio (5:1 or worse), sorted by altitude lost (deepest first)

**Task Tab Features:**
- Lists all turnpoints in order with:
  - Turnpoint number and name
  - Type badge (Takeoff/Start/Turnpoint/Goal) with color coding
  - Cylinder radius
  - Altitude (if available)
  - Leg distance (from previous turnpoint)
  - Cumulative distance from start
- Updates automatically when a task is loaded

**Events Tab Features:**
- Click on an event: Pan to event location and highlight on map

**Glides Tab Features:**
- Header: "Sorted by distance (longest first)"
- Each glide shows: rank (#1, #2...), distance (km), time range, and stats:
  - **L/D** - Glide ratio
  - **Spd** - Average speed (km/h)
  - **Alt** - Altitude lost (m)
  - **Dur** - Duration (mm:ss)
- Start/end altitudes displayed

**Climbs Tab Features:**
- Header: "Sorted by altitude gain (highest first)"
- Each climb shows: rank (#1, #2...), altitude gain (m), time range, and stats:
  - **Avg** - Average climb rate (m/s)
  - **Dur** - Duration (mm:ss)
- Start/end altitudes displayed
- Green accent color for climb items to distinguish from glides

**Sinks Tab Features:**
- Header: "Glides with L/D ≤ 5:1, sorted by altitude lost"
- Only shows glides with L/D ratio of 5:1 or worse (indicating strong sink)
- Each sink shows: rank (#1, #2...), altitude lost (m), time range, and stats:
  - **L/D** - Glide ratio (always ≤5:1)
  - **Avg** - Average sink rate (m/s)
  - **Dist** - Distance covered (km)
  - **Spd** - Average speed (km/h)
  - **Dur** - Duration (mm:ss)
- Start/end altitudes displayed
- Red accent color for sink items to indicate descent

**Cross-Tab Selection Sync:**
- Selecting a glide_start or glide_end event in Events tab → switching to Glides or Sinks highlights the corresponding item
- Selecting a thermal_entry or thermal_exit event in Events tab → switching to Climbs highlights the corresponding climb
- Selecting a glide in Glides tab → switching to Events highlights the corresponding glide_start event
- Selecting a climb in Climbs tab → switching to Events highlights the corresponding thermal_entry event
- Selecting a sink in Sinks tab → switching to Events highlights the corresponding glide_start event
- Selected item automatically scrolls into view when switching tabs

### Event Selection Visualization
When an event is selected from the panel, the map highlights the event location with segment lines, endpoint markers, glide chevrons, and speed labels. Full visual details (colors, sizes, throb animation, zoom-dependent label visibility) are defined in the "Event Highlight" section of [`mapbox-interactions-spec.md`](mapbox-interactions-spec.md).

**Selection Clearing**: Event selection and all associated visualizations (segment highlight, markers, legend) are automatically cleared when:
- Loading a new IGC file
- Toggling 3D track mode
- Anything else that results in the visualisation or information presented being unrelated to the track or task being shown.

### IGC Parser
Parses standard IGC files according to FAI specification:
- A record (device ID)
- H records (header info: date, pilot, glider)
- B records (GPS fixes with timestamp, position, altitude)
- C records (task declaration)
- E records (events)

### XContest Task Parser
Supports both v1 (full JSON) and v2 (compact QR code) formats:
- Fetches tasks from `tools.xcontest.org/api/xctsk/load/{code}`
- Parses turnpoint definitions, SSS/ESS markers, cylinder radii
- Handles both WGS84 and FAI Sphere earth models
- See https://tools.xcontest.org/xctsk for api documentation

### Event Detection Algorithms
- **Thermals**: Rolling window analysis of vertical speed, minimum duration threshold (see `event-detection/thermal-detection-spec.md` for detailed algorithm documentation)
- **Glides**: Segments between thermals with calculated L/D ratio (see `event-detection/glide-detection-spec.md` for detailed algorithm documentation)
- **Circle detection**: Cumulative heading change to detect individual thermal circles, with wind estimation from circle drift (see `event-detection/circling-flight-and-thermal-analysis-research.md`)
- **Turnpoint sequencing**: Cylinder crossing detection and CIVL GAP-compliant turnpoint sequence resolution, including SSS direction validation and best-progress scoring
- **Cylinder crossings**: WGS84 ellipsoid distance checks (Andoyer-Lambert) against turnpoint radii
- **Vario extremes**: Smoothed vertical speed analysis
- **GAP scoring**: Multi-track task scoring implementing the CIVL GAP formula (FAI Sporting Code Section 7F). Calculates task validity, weight distribution, distance/time/leading/arrival points. Supports both PG and HG scoring with configurable competition parameters (nominal distance/goal/time, minimum distance, leading/arrival toggles).
