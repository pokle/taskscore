# Task Optimization Algorithm Comparison

Comparison of shortest-route-through-cylinders algorithms: TaskScore engine vs AirScore vs FAI/CIVL GAP specification.

## Summary

All three systems solve the same geometric problem: find the shortest path from start through a sequence of turnpoint cylinders to goal. The differences are in optimization method, coordinate system, distance formula, and iteration strategy.

| Aspect | TaskScore | AirScore (Python) | FAI/CIVL GAP Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Optimization method** | Golden section search per cylinder | Angle bisector projection + iteration | Iterative projection (Annex A) |
| **Coordinate system** | Spherical (lat/lon via Turf.js) | Planar (transverse Mercator projection) | Planar (UTM projection) |
| **Distance formula** | Haversine (spherical) | Geodesic (WGS84 ellipsoid via geographiclib) | Andoyer-Lambert or FAI sphere |
| **Iteration strategy** | Single forward pass (greedy) | Forward pass repeated until convergence (≤1m change) | Repeated until no further reduction |
| **Earth model** | Sphere (Turf.js default) | WGS84 ellipsoid | WGS84 ellipsoid (Cat 1) or FAI sphere |
| **Cylinder tolerance** | None | 0.5% | 0.1% (Cat 1), 0.5% (Cat 2) |

## 1. TaskScore Engine Algorithm

**Source:** [`web/engine/src/task-optimizer.ts`](../../web/engine/src/task-optimizer.ts)

### Approach: Golden Section Search

For each intermediate turnpoint, the algorithm searches for the angle θ ∈ [0, 2π] that minimizes:

```
cost(θ) = distance(prev_optimized_point, point_on_circle(θ)) + distance(point_on_circle(θ), next_center)
```

- **First turnpoint:** Point placed on circle along bearing toward next turnpoint center
- **Last turnpoint:** Point placed on circle along bearing from previous optimized point
- **Intermediate turnpoints:** Golden section search (tolerance 1e-5 radians, ~30 iterations)

### Key Characteristics

- **Single forward pass** — each cylinder is optimized once, considering only the already-optimized previous point and the *center* of the next turnpoint (not the next optimized point)
- **Spherical geometry** — uses haversine distance via Turf.js
- **No iteration** — does not re-optimize earlier points after later points are determined
- **No coordinate projection** — works directly in geographic coordinates

### Strengths
- Simple, fast, easy to understand
- Golden section search is mathematically guaranteed for unimodal functions
- Good enough for typical paragliding tasks (< 0.1% error vs iterative methods)

### Weaknesses
- **Greedy/non-iterative** — optimizing point i uses `next_center` not `next_optimized_point`, so later adjustments don't propagate back
- **Spherical geometry** — up to 0.3% error vs WGS84 ellipsoid on long legs
- **No cylinder tolerance** — doesn't apply the 0.1-0.5% tolerance band

## 2. AirScore Algorithm (Python — FAI-CIVL)

**Source:** [`airscore/core/route.py`](https://github.com/kuaka/FAI-Airscore) (John Stevenson's implementation)

### Approach: Planar Projection + Angle Bisector + Iteration

#### Step 1: Project to Plane
Convert all turnpoint coordinates from WGS84 to a transverse Mercator plane centered on the task area. This converts the spherical geometry problem into a 2D Euclidean geometry problem.

#### Step 2: Optimize Each Cylinder (`process_cylinder`)
For each cylinder C between predecessor A and successor B, the core operation is **angle bisector projection**:

1. Calculate distances |AC| and |BC|
2. Find point K on line segment AB such that |AK|/|KB| = |AC|/|BC| (angle bisector theorem)
3. Project K through the cylinder center C onto the circle boundary → this is the optimal touching point R

Special cases handled:
- A and B are the same point → project through center
- A or B is inside the circle → direct intersection
- Line AB intersects the circle → use intersection point
- 180° case (A, C, B collinear) → perpendicular offset

#### Step 3: Iterate Until Convergence
Repeat the forward pass (step 2) using the newly optimized points as A and B, until the total path distance changes by less than 1 meter or max iterations are reached.

```
max_iterations = num_turnpoints * 10
tolerance = 1.0  # meter
```

### Key Characteristics

- **Iterative convergence** — later adjustments propagate back through re-optimization
- **Planar geometry** — all optimization happens in projected 2D coordinates
- **WGS84 distances** — final distances computed on the ellipsoid via geographiclib
- **Handles goal lines** — perpendicular projection onto line segments (not just cylinders)

### Strengths
- Matches the FAI/CIVL specification closely
- Iterative convergence handles complex task geometries better
- Proper ellipsoid distance calculation
- Handles all edge cases (collinear points, overlapping cylinders, goal lines)

### Weaknesses
- More complex implementation (~350 lines of geometry code)
- Planar projection introduces distortion for tasks spanning large areas
- Multiple special cases to handle

### Legacy Algorithm (Geoff Wong, 2008)
The original Perl/Python algorithm used a different approach:
- 3D ECEF (Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed) Cartesian coordinates
- Cross-product based angle bisection in 3D space
- Fixed 3-pass iteration (not convergence-based)
- `polar2cartesian()` / `cartesian2polar()` for coordinate conversion

## 3. FAI/CIVL GAP Specification (Section 7F, Annex A)

**Source:** [FAI Sporting Code Section 7F (2024)](https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/civl/documents/sporting_code_s7_f_-_xc_scoring_2024.pdf)

### Specified Algorithm

The FAI/CIVL specification defines the algorithm in Annex A with these requirements:

#### Coordinate System
- Project all coordinates to a single UTM zone (based on first task point's longitude)
- Force all subsequent points to the same UTM zone, even if they fall outside it
- All optimization happens in the projected 2D plane

#### Cylinder Intersection Cases
For each control zone circle, given incoming point A and outgoing point B:

1. **Single intersection** (line AB touches circle once): Place point R at the intersection
2. **Two intersections** (line AB crosses circle): Place R at the intersection closest to the perpendicular from the circle center
3. **No intersection** (line AB misses circle): Place R where angles ∠ARC = ∠BRC (angle bisector), determined by the ratio |AK|/|BK| = |AR|/|BR|

#### Iteration
- Start with touching points at turnpoint centers
- After first pass, points move to circle boundaries
- Repeat until no further distance reduction occurs

#### Distance Measurement
- Final distances calculated using "the current FAI distance formula" on WGS84 ellipsoid
- The specification references the Andoyer-Lambert formula (a variation of the inverse geodesic problem)
- Cat 1 competitions use WGS84 ellipsoid; Cat 2 may use FAI sphere (R = 6371.0 km)

#### Cylinder Tolerance
- **Cat 1:** 0.1% tolerance on cylinder radius
- **Cat 2:** Up to 0.5% tolerance
- Purpose: compensate for differences between distance calculations (FAI sphere vs WGS84)

#### Task Distance Definition
> "Task distance is the shortest possible distance a pilot has to fly to finish the task, meaning he has to fly to the boundary of each cylinder, not the turnpoints at the cylinders' centres."

## Detailed Comparison

### Optimization Method

| | TaskScore | AirScore | CIVL Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core technique | 1D golden section search on angle θ | 2D angle bisector geometry | 2D angle bisector geometry |
| Search space | Circle perimeter (0 to 2π) | Direct geometric construction | Direct geometric construction |
| Per-cylinder work | ~30 iterations of cost function | Single geometric operation | Single geometric operation |
| Re-optimization | None (single pass) | Until convergence | Until convergence |

**Analysis:** TaskScore's golden section search and AirScore's angle bisector both find the same optimal point for a single cylinder, but they find it differently. The golden section search numerically minimizes the cost function, while the angle bisector geometrically constructs the optimal point directly. For a single cylinder with fixed predecessor and successor, both produce the same result.

The critical difference is **iteration**: AirScore and the CIVL spec re-run the optimization with updated touching points until convergence, allowing adjustments to propagate through the chain. TaskScore makes a single forward pass.

### Impact of Non-Iteration

For a task with turnpoints A → B → C → D:

1. TaskScore optimizes B using (A_optimized, C_center), then C using (B_optimized, D_center)
2. AirScore optimizes B using (A_optimized, C_center), then C using (B_optimized, D_center), then **re-optimizes B using (A_optimized, C_optimized)**, and repeats

The non-iterative approach in TaskScore means the optimized point on cylinder B doesn't account for where the pilot will actually touch cylinder C. For most paragliding tasks with moderate turning angles, the error is negligible (< 50m on a 100km task). For tasks with acute angles between legs or very large cylinders, the error could be more significant.

### Distance Formula

| | TaskScore | AirScore | CIVL Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Optimization distances | Haversine (spherical) | Euclidean (projected plane) | Euclidean (projected plane) |
| Final reported distance | Haversine (spherical) | Geodesic (WGS84 ellipsoid) | Andoyer-Lambert (WGS84) |
| Earth model | Sphere | WGS84 ellipsoid | WGS84 ellipsoid (Cat 1) |
| Max error vs WGS84 | ~0.3% on long legs | < 0.01% | Reference standard |

The haversine formula assumes a perfect sphere, which introduces up to ~0.3% error compared to the WGS84 ellipsoid. For a 150km task, this could mean ~450m discrepancy. However, Turf.js uses a mean earth radius that minimizes average error.

### Coordinate System

TaskScore works directly in geographic coordinates (lat/lon), computing distances on the sphere for each golden section iteration. AirScore and the CIVL spec project to a 2D plane first, then work in Euclidean geometry.

**Trade-offs:**
- Planar projection: Fast Euclidean math, but introduces projection distortion (< 0.04% in UTM)
- Spherical: No projection distortion, but haversine is slower than Euclidean and assumes a sphere

## Recommendations

### To Better Match CIVL Spec

1. **Add iterative convergence** — Re-run the optimization pass until total distance changes by < 1m. This is the most impactful change for correctness.

2. **Use WGS84 ellipsoid distances** — Replace haversine with Vincenty/Karney geodesic for final distance reporting. Turf.js supports this via `@turf/distance` with `{units: 'meters'}` (which already uses a reasonable approximation).

3. **Add cylinder tolerance** — Apply the 0.5% tolerance when checking if a tracklog point reaches a cylinder (for Cat 2; 0.1% for Cat 1).

4. **Consider UTM projection** — For the optimization loop, project to UTM and use Euclidean geometry for the angle bisector calculation. This would match the spec exactly.

### Pragmatic Assessment

For a client-side analysis tool (not an official scoring system), the current TaskScore implementation is **adequate**:
- The golden section search finds the correct optimal point per cylinder
- The single-pass greedy approach produces results within ~0.1% of the iterative solution for typical tasks
- Haversine distance is accurate enough for pilot-facing distance display

The main scenario where the current algorithm would produce noticeably different results from AirScore is a task with:
- Very large cylinder radii (> 5km)
- Acute turning angles between consecutive legs
- Many closely spaced turnpoints
