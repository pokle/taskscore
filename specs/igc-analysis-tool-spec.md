# IGC Analysis Tool Specification

## Overview

The IGC Analysis Tool is a browser-based flight analysis application that allows pilots to visualize and analyze their paragliding/hanggliding flights. It parses IGC files, displays the track on an interactive 3D map, and detects flight events for analysis.

Single page app
- source `pages/src/analysis.html`
- Deployed to https://taskscore.shonky.info/analysis

## Features

### File Input
- **IGC File Upload**: Drag-and-drop or file picker for IGC files
- **XContest Task Code**: Load competition tasks by entering the task code from xcontest.org

### Map Display
- **3D Terrain**: MapBox GL JS with terrain elevation and sky atmosphere
- **Track Visualization**: Flight track displayed with altitude-based coloring (toggleable)
  - Brown: Low altitude (0-1000m) - earthy colors near the ground
  - Green: Medium altitude (1000-2000m) - transitional
  - Light Blue: High altitude (2000-3000m) - approaching sky
  - Sky Blue: Very high altitude (>3000m) - sky colors at altitude
- **Task Display**:
  - Turnpoint cylinders with color coding (green=SSS, yellow=ESS, purple=intermediate)
    - Label at center of waypoint with name, radius, altitude and role (e.g. "ELLIOT, R 5km, A 3067m, SSS")
  - Optimised line connecting turnpoints
    - Dotted
    - Label in the centre of line with distance and leg number (e.g. "Leg 1: 15.2km")

### Track Interaction
Users can click directly on the flight track to view event details:

- **Click on Track**: Clicking anywhere on the track selects the corresponding event
  - If the clicked point is within a segment (glide, thermal, or sink), that segment is selected
  - The event panel opens automatically if closed
  - The panel switches to the appropriate tab (Glides, Climbs, or Sinks) based on segment type
  - The map pans to the event location with segment highlighting
- **Hover Feedback**: Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over the track to indicate it's clickable

This provides an alternative to browsing the event panel - pilots can click directly on interesting parts of the track to see details.

### Command Palette (⌘K)

| Takeoff | First moment of significant ground speed (>5 m/s) |
| Landing | Last moment of significant ground speed |
| Thermal Entry | Start of sustained climb (>0.5 m/s average) |
| Thermal Exit | End of thermal with altitude gain reported |
| Glide Start/End | Straight glide segments between thermals |
| Turnpoint Entry/Exit | Crossing turnpoint cylinder boundaries |
| Start Crossing | Crossing SSS cylinder (race start) |
| Goal Crossing | Crossing goal cylinder/line |
| Max/Min Altitude | Altitude extremes during flight |
| Max Climb/Sink | Maximum vertical speeds |

### Event Panel
Sidebar panel with tabbed interface for viewing flight data. The main tabs appear in the header bar and control the sidebar content.

**Header Tabs (always visible):**
- **Track** - Flight track analysis with sub-tabs for events, glides, climbs, and sinks
- **Task** - Task turnpoints with optimized distances, radii, and altitudes
- **Terrain** - Flying area information (planned feature - currently placeholder)
- **>>** (Hide) - Collapses the sidebar to show full map; clicking any other tab reopens it

**Track Tab Sub-tabs:**
- **Events** - Chronological list of all detected events (takeoff, thermals, glides, landing, etc.)
- **Glides** - Glides sorted by distance (longest first), combining start/end info into single entries
- **Climbs** - Thermals sorted by altitude gain (highest first), combining entry/exit info into single entries
- **Sinks** - Glides with poor L/D ratio (5:1 or worse), sorted by altitude lost (deepest first)

**Task Tab Features:**
- Lists all turnpoints in order with:
  - Turnpoint number and name
  - Type badge (Takeoff/Start/Turnpoint/Goal) with color coding
  - Cylinder radius
  - Altitude (if available)
  - Leg distance (from previous turnpoint)
  - Cumulative distance from start
- Updates automatically when a task is loaded

- Will include: common waypoints, danger zones, lift generators, thermal hotspots, competition links

**Events Tab Features:**
- Click on an event: Pan to event location and highlight on map

**Glides Tab Features:**
- Header: "Sorted by distance (longest first)"
- Each glide shows: rank (#1, #2...), distance (km), time range, and stats:
  - **L/D** - Glide ratio

  - **Avg** - Average climb rate (m/s)
  - **Dur** - Duration (mm:ss)
- Start/end altitudes displayed
- Green accent color for climb items to distinguish from glides

**Sinks Tab Features:**
- Header: "Glides with L/D ≤ 5:1, sorted by altitude lost"
- Only shows glides with L/D ratio of 5:1 or worse (indicating strong sink)
- Each sink shows: rank (#1, #2...), altitude lost (m), time range, and stats:
  - **L/D** - Glide ratio (always ≤5:1)
  - **Avg** - Average sink rate (m/s)
  - **Dist** - Distance covered (km)
  - **Spd** - Average speed (km/h)
  - **Dur** - Duration (mm:ss)
- Start/end altitudes displayed
- Red accent color for sink items to indicate descent

**Cross-Tab Selection Sync:**
- Selecting a glide_start or glide_end event in Events tab → switching to Glides or Sinks highlights the corresponding item
- Selecting a thermal_entry or thermal_exit event in Events tab → switching to Climbs highlights the corresponding climb
- Selecting a glide in Glides tab → switching to Events highlights the corresponding glide_start event
- Selecting a climb in Climbs tab → switching to Events highlights the corresponding thermal_entry event
- Selecting a sink in Sinks tab → switching to Events highlights the corresponding glide_start event
- Selected item automatically scrolls into view when switching tabs

### Event Selection Visualization
When an event is selected from the panel:

- **Segment Highlighting**: For thermal and glide events, the corresponding track segment is highlighted with a bright cyan line (6px width) to clearly show the extent of the segment
- **Auto-Popup**: A popup appears showing event details (description, time, altitude) anchored to:
  - Entry/start point for thermal_entry and glide_start events
  - Exit/end point for thermal_exit and glide_end events
  - Event location for point events (takeoff, max altitude, etc.)
- **Segment Markers**: For segment events (thermals, glides), two markers are displayed:
  - **Start marker**: Ring/outline style circle at the segment start
  - **End marker**: Filled circle at the segment end
- **Point Marker**: For non-segment events, a single filled marker at the event location
- **Glide Direction Chevrons**: When a glide event is selected, chevron markers are displayed along the glide path to indicate flight direction:
  - Chevrons placed every 500m along the glide trail
  - Each chevron rotated to match the local track bearing at that point
  - Blue chevron markers with white outline for visibility
  - Performance labels displayed 250m before each chevron showing metrics for the 500m segment (MapBox only):
    - **Speed**: Average speed in km/h (e.g., "45km/h")
    - **Glide ratio**: L/D ratio for the segment (e.g., "12:1"), shows "∞:1" if climbing/level
    - **Altitude change**: Altitude difference in meters (e.g., "-42m" for descent, "+5m" for climb)
    - Example display: "45km/h" on first line, "12:1 -42m" on second line
    - Labels styled with blue text and white text shadow for readability
- **Glide Metrics Legend**: A help button appears at the bottom-right of the map when a glide event is selected:
  - Blue circular "?" button that expands on click
  - Shows explanations for: chevron spacing (500m segments), speed, L/D ratio, and altitude change
  - Automatically hidden when selecting non-glide events

**Selection Clearing**: Event selection and all associated visualizations (segment highlight, markers, legend) are automatically cleared when:
- Loading a new IGC file
- Toggling 3D track mode
- Toggling altitude colors mode
- Anything else that results in the visualisation or information presented being unrelated to the track or task being shown.

This visual system helps pilots quickly identify and understand the spatial extent of flight phases.

### IGC Parser
Parses standard IGC files according to FAI specification:
- A record (device ID)
- H records (header info: date, pilot, glider)
- B records (GPS fixes with timestamp, position, altitude)
- C records (task declaration)
- E records (events)

### XContest Task Parser
Supports both v1 (full JSON) and v2 (compact QR code) formats:
- Fetches tasks from `tools.xcontest.org/api/xctsk/load/{code}`
- Parses turnpoint definitions, SSS/ESS markers, cylinder radii
- Handles both WGS84 and FAI Sphere earth models
- See https://tools.xcontest.org/xctsk for api documentation

### Event Detection Algorithms
- **Thermals**: Rolling window analysis of vertical speed, minimum duration threshold
- **Glides**: Segments between thermals with calculated L/D ratio
- **Cylinder crossings**: Haversine distance checks against turnpoint radii
- **Vario extremes**: Smoothed vertical speed analysis
