# IGC Analysis Tool Specification

## Overview

The IGC Analysis Tool is a browser-based flight analysis application that allows pilots to visualize and analyze their paragliding/hanggliding flights. It parses IGC files, displays the track on an interactive 3D map, and detects flight events for analysis.

## Features

### File Input
- **IGC File Upload**: Drag-and-drop or file picker for IGC files
- **XContest Task Code**: Load competition tasks by entering the task code from xcontest.org

### Map Display
- **3D Terrain**: MapLibre GL JS with hillshade and terrain elevation
- **Track Visualization**: Flight track displayed with altitude-based coloring
  - Blue: Low altitude (0-1000m)
  - Green: Medium altitude (1000-2000m)
  - Yellow: High altitude (2000-3000m)
  - Red: Very high altitude (>3000m)
- **Task Display**:
  - Turnpoint cylinders with color coding (green=SSS, yellow=ESS, purple=intermediate)
  - Task line connecting turnpoints
  - Waypoint labels

### Event Detection
The tool automatically detects and displays:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Takeoff | First moment of significant ground speed (>5 m/s) |
| Landing | Last moment of significant ground speed |
| Thermal Entry | Start of sustained climb (>0.5 m/s average) |
| Thermal Exit | End of thermal with altitude gain reported |
| Glide Start/End | Straight glide segments between thermals |
| Turnpoint Entry/Exit | Crossing turnpoint cylinder boundaries |
| Start Crossing | Crossing SSS cylinder (race start) |
| Goal Crossing | Crossing goal cylinder/line |
| Max/Min Altitude | Altitude extremes during flight |
| Max Climb/Sink | Maximum vertical speeds |

### Event Panel
- Collapsible sidebar listing all detected events
- Filter toggle to show only events visible in current map view
- Events grouped by category (Key Events, Thermals, Glides, Turnpoints, Statistics)
- Click-to-pan: clicking an event centers the map on that location

### Event Selection Visualization
When an event is selected from the panel:

- **Segment Highlighting**: For thermal and glide events, the corresponding track segment is highlighted with a bright cyan line (6px width) to clearly show the extent of the segment
- **Auto-Popup**: A popup appears showing event details (description, time, altitude) anchored to:
  - Entry/start point for thermal_entry and glide_start events
  - Exit/end point for thermal_exit and glide_end events
  - Event location for point events (takeoff, max altitude, etc.)
- **Segment Markers**: For segment events (thermals, glides), two markers are displayed:
  - **Start marker**: Ring/outline style circle at the segment start
  - **End marker**: Filled circle at the segment end
- **Point Marker**: For non-segment events, a single filled marker at the event location

This visual system helps pilots quickly identify and understand the spatial extent of flight phases.

├── igc-parser.ts     # IGC file format parser

```

### IGC Parser
Parses standard IGC files according to FAI specification:
- A record (device ID)
- H records (header info: date, pilot, glider)
- B records (GPS fixes with timestamp, position, altitude)
- C records (task declaration)
- E records (events)

### XContest Task Parser
Supports both v1 (full JSON) and v2 (compact QR code) formats:
- Fetches tasks from `tools.xcontest.org/api/xctsk/load/{code}`
- Parses turnpoint definitions, SSS/ESS markers, cylinder radii
- Handles both WGS84 and FAI Sphere earth models
- See https://tools.xcontest.org/xctsk for api documentation

### Event Detection Algorithms
- **Thermals**: Rolling window analysis of vertical speed, minimum duration threshold
- **Glides**: Segments between thermals with calculated L/D ratio
- **Cylinder crossings**: Haversine distance checks against turnpoint radii
- **Vario extremes**: Smoothed vertical speed analysis

## Data Formats
